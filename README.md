## 🧩 Why We Created ProductivityHub

In today's world, professionals and students alike juggle between multiple apps:
- ✅ One app for **to-do lists**
- 📝 Another for **notes or study material**
- 📈 Yet another for **tracking personal trades or growth**

**Switching context** between these tools leads to wasted time, scattered information, and reduced focus.

**ProductivityHub** was built to **solve this** by offering a **centralized, distraction-free workspace** where you can:
- Plan your tasks
- Record and review notes
- Log trades with key performance indicators

> 🚀 Everything you need. In one place. Without noise.
